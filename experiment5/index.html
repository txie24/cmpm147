		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This project essentially uses a genetic algorithm to create a generator that “splits” an original image into mosaics, which then evolve through a 30-second manual annealing process, culminating in us “squinting” to recognize the original image. We control the mutation rate with a slider: 100 % for extensive exploration, 1 % for almost static, thus realizing a coarse → fine adaptive search.
	</div>

	<div class="minor-section">
		<h2>Technical</h2>
		<p>Sampling: initDesign() first reads the inspiration image and automatically performs k-means (K=6) to get the main color. If the image is almost black and white, then go pixel-mode, otherwise press inspiration.grid to build a colored square.</p>
		<p>Mutations: mutateDesign() uses Gaussian dithering σ ∝ rate to change position/size/color, we can clearly see all the squares moving at high speed especially when the mutation rate is high.</p>
		<p>Valuation: The squared error is compared pixel by pixel with the original image scaled to the same size after rendering, scoring 1/(1+MSE), and the optimal photo is saved below by memorialize().</p>
	</div>

	<div class="minor-section">
		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>This project was done by team, with me, Hengyang Ye, and my teammate, Tinyu Xie, and we decided to write Reflection separately because it was unlikely that we would get the exact same feedback. My biggest feeling about this assignment is actually funny, initially I first posted some pictures that were really hard to do a good performance, but then I was much better after I went with what the PPT said that I should have chosen a higher contrast photo, which I was going to try and then gave up on.</p>
